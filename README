TODO:

X add support for '^' operator, aka "x ^ y" , "x to the power of y"

X store last result to tmp var

* add a switch that puts output in Hexadecimal or Binary, this way I can
	instantly see what 49714 is in hex.

	Answer: it's 0b1100001000110010 && 0xC232

	I added support for -H & -B switches.  There is a catch, the program
	dies when you write a - symbol in front of a number.

* add support for multiple argument calculations: $ ftc "2 + 3 * 4"

* add support for parentheses: $ ftc "(2 + 3) * 4"

* re-write all the sketchy parts (there are many)
